- Playerview themes - able to switch themes
- Themes
    - Far West
    - Odyssey
- Add option to create a fighter and then add their initiative dice
    - Before I put in the checkNum on Action, putting in a String changed it to look like "1d+", might be something there to work with
- Limit the number of combatants and fields a person can have (1 field, 10 fighters)
- New fighter didn't get added to playerview if playerview is visible.
- Make it so status bar doesn't exist if Statuses don't
- Style Authy
- Add Weapon input doesn't have the correct font
- Add Fighter HM styling is a little cramped - see if there's something that can be done
- With a negative init the Action shows up as "1d12+-3"
